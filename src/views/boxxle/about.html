            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>The game on this site is modeled on a popular video game from the late 1980s, called Boxxle. Although there are emulators for this game, this site is a complete re-write of the game utilizing web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery).

            <p>As you can see in the vdeo above, the game requires very little instructions to play. What you see above is level 1 of the game. Your job is to move all the crates until they are positioned in the squares that have dots on them. As you complete
                each level successfully, you will be automatically transported to the next level. Each level is more difficult than the previous level. The goal is to complete all 16 levels. When you first enter the site, you will be prompted to enter
